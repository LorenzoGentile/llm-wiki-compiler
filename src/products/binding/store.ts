/**
 * @file src/products/binding/store.ts
 * @description Atomic, durable read/write of `.llmwiki/active-product.json`, the
 * single active-product authority pointer (design sections 8.2, 8.3). The read is
 * confined and no-follow through the shared hardened leaf reader (reached by its
 * local-disk storage wrapper, which passes it through unchanged), so a symlinked
 * `.llmwiki` dir OR a symlinked/oversize/non-regular binding leaf fails closed as
 * `malformed` rather than reading out-of-tree bytes; a genuinely absent binding is
 * `absent` (the legacy-mode signal). The write goes through the shared durable
 * atomic replace (write-temp -> fsync -> atomic rename -> parent fsync -> verify),
 * the same primitive the run, catalog, and relation stores use, so a fault at any
 * point leaves ONLY the complete-old or complete-new binding on disk, never a
 * partial one. `profileJsonPresent` is the read used to detect the design section
 * 8.2 product-authority conflict.
 *
 * READ SIDE: {@link readActiveProductBinding} and {@link profileJsonPresent} each
 * run one body over local-disk {@link ActiveBindingReads}. What an unreadable
 * leaf, an empty alias, a failed directory resolution or a failed look MEANS is
 * decided in those bodies, catch-alls included; the reads only look.
 *
 * WRITE SIDE: {@link writeActiveProductBindingTo} keeps the canonical bytes and
 * the fault-seam order (before, the two straddling the rename, after) over
 * {@link ActiveBindingWrite}; {@link writeActiveProductBinding} passes
 * {@link diskActiveBindingWrite}, the incumbent durable, exact-parent, 0600
 * atomic replace of `.llmwiki/active-product.json`.
