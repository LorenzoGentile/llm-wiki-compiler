/**
 * @file src/relations/store-version.ts
 * @description The explicit, under-lock relation-store schema upgrade. Before the
 * first operation-bound append, the store header is raised from the ordinary base
 * write version to the operation version through a durable whole-file
 * replacement, preserving every existing record byte and its order. An absent
 * store is created header-only at the operation version; an already-upgraded
 * store is left untouched; a corrupt, torn, too-new, symlinked, or unavailable
 * store throws (surfaced through the no-follow reader) and is never upgraded.
 *
 * ONE BODY: {@link ensureRelationOperationVersionLocked} runs
 * {@link ensureRelationOperationVersionLockedFrom} over local-disk
 * {@link RelationUpgradeSources}: this store's graph read plus ONE raw write,
 * the DURABLE whole-store replacement, a member of its own. The version
 * decisions, the refusals and their messages, and the bytes written stay here.
