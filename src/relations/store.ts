/**
 * @file src/relations/store.ts
 * @description The WRITE half of the append-only relation store. Canonicalizes
 * symmetric endpoints, validates the CANONICAL relation against its profile
 * relation-type def, mints a stable `rel_<ULID>` id, and APPENDS the record
 * (record + checksum) under the project lock as a single writer. A new store
 * gets a header line first. The read half lives in `store-read.ts`.
 *
 * DEDUP (FIX #6): under the lock, an append whose `contentHash` matches a LIVE
 * relation short-circuits to that existing ref WITHOUT appending — so a
 * symmetric (a→b) then (b→a) (which canonicalize identically) collapse to ONE
 * record. Creates are idempotent on content.
 *
 * DURABILITY: appends use O_APPEND under a bounded-blocking project lock so a
 * single writer extends the file. There is NO fsync: a clean process crash can
 * leave a torn TRAILING line (the reader tolerates and reports it), but
 * power-loss durability is NOT provided, and an interior tear fails the store
 * closed. Appends FAIL CLOSED ({@link RelationStoreFullError}) at the read cap;
 * {@link compactRelations} is the escape valve. CONFINEMENT: the graph dir is
 * resolved through {@link resolveGraphDir}, which fails closed if `wiki/graph` is
 * a symlink escaping root.
 *
 * UPDATE: because the store is append-only, {@link updateRelation} appends a
 * NEW record carrying the SAME `id` with a recomputed `contentHash`, under ONE
 * lock with its base re-read (FIX #5, no lost update). The reader returns the
 * latest record per id, so the prior record is superseded while staying on disk
 * for audit. Changing `type`/`from`/`to` is a delete+create (a different edge)
 * and is NOT an update — callers pass only attributes/evidence.
 *
 * TRUST BOUNDARY: the per-record `contentHash` is an INTEGRITY checksum (it
 * detects an accidentally-corrupted or torn record, failing the read closed) — it
 * is NOT an AUTHENTICITY chain. Unlike the event store, this store carries no
 * hash-CHAIN linking each record to the prior, so it cannot detect a well-formed
 * record that was FORGED or a live record that was SILENTLY DELETED by something
 * writing the file directly. Every TOOLED write path is guarded (profile-lock
 * single-writer + graph-dir confinement), so no CLI/SDK/MCP caller can forge an
 * edge; the residual exposure is an actor with DIRECT filesystem write access to
 * `wiki/graph`, who could plant a relation that satisfies a gated lifecycle
 * precondition (G1) with no tamper-evidence. Deployments that must resist that
 * threat MUST protect the graph directory at the OS/filesystem layer (restrictive
 * ownership/permissions, or an immutable/append-only mount); a future authenticity
 * hash-chain over the relation store would close it in-band. This is a deliberate
 * v0 boundary, scoped and documented rather than silently assumed.
 *
 * ONE BODY for the create: {@link appendRelationLocked} runs
 * {@link appendRelationLockedFrom} over local-disk {@link RelationAppendSources}
 * — this store's graph (its confined read and its handle-held append) and the
 * audit store's write sources. Validation, the audit pre-flight and repair, the
 * dedup, the event, the record bytes, the cap and the order record-then-event
 * are decided here; the sources only answer. The disk append reaches this
 * store's own `resolveGraphDir` and `openStoreFileAppend` (`./store-record.ts`)
 * at call time. The exported root {@link appendLine} (the operation-bound
 * writer's) runs the same record chunks. The cross-store residual below is
 * unchanged: the record and its event are NOT co-committed.
 *
 * ONE BODY for the update and the compaction too: {@link updateRelation} runs
 * {@link updateRelationLockedFrom} over the SAME local-disk
 * {@link RelationAppendSources}, and {@link compactRelations} runs
 * {@link compactRelationsLockedFrom} over {@link RelationCompactionSources},
 * whose disk rewrite keeps the confined graph dir, the mkdir, the sizing and the
 * random `wx` temp then rename. Both keep their lock, their read-before-mkdir
 * order, the bound-history refusal and the event pre-flight and order.

 * header + those records to a RANDOM-named, O_EXCL-created temp file in the
 * confined graph dir (see {@link writeCompactedAtomically} — a pre-planted
 * symlink at the temp path fails the open closed, never followed outside root),
 * and atomic-rename it over `relations.jsonl`. Superseded/duplicate/now-invalid
 * records are dropped, so the store SHRINKS — the escape valve that recovers a
 * store driven up to {@link RelationStoreFullError}. The latest-per-id collapse
 * is the reader's, so no live relation is lost.
 *
 * MANDATORY AUDIT (FIX F2, mirroring {@link appendRelationLocked}): the audit
 * event store is PRE-FLIGHTED for both HEALTH ({@link prepareEventStoreForAppendFrom})
 * AND the `relation-compact` event's SIZE + whole-store fit
 * ({@link preflightEventAppend} over the EXACT event built by
 * {@link buildCompactionEvent}), under the held lock, BEFORE
 * {@link writeCompactedAtomically} mutates the relation store. A tampered /
 * too-new / symlinked audit store, an over-cap event record, OR a near-full event
 * store therefore BLOCKS the compaction up front (throws) and leaves
 * `relations.jsonl` BYTE-IDENTICAL — a healthy, fitting audit log is a
 * PRECONDITION, not a best-effort after-mutation emit.
 *
 * @param root - Absolute project root.
 * @param profile - The governing profile pack (records invalid against it are dropped).
 * @returns The store file's byte size before and after compaction.
