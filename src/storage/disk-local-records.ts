/**
 * @file src/storage/disk-local-records.ts
 * @description The local-directory implementation of {@link LegacyLocalRecords}.
 *
 * Each method makes the call the record's module made inline before the
 * binding existed, on the same absolute path, and lets that call's own error
 * through untouched:
 *
 *  - the read opens with `O_RDONLY | O_NOFOLLOW` through the shared hardened
 *    opener, so a symlinked leaf fails the open instead of being read THROUGH
 *    to out-of-tree bytes, and a FIFO or other special file is refused rather
 *    than blocking;
 *  - the write is the shared hardened {@link atomicWrite} (random exclusive
 *    temp, then rename) confined to the project root, so it inherits the same
 *    leaf-symlink write-escape defences as every page write.
