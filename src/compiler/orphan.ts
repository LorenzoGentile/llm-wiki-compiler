/**
 * Orphan management for deleted source files.
 *
 * When a source is deleted, its exclusively-owned concept pages are marked
 * orphaned (orphaned: true in frontmatter). Shared concepts are deferred so
 * the compiler can rebuild them from their surviving owners in the same run.
 *
 * After compilation, reconciliation candidates and extraction-frozen slugs
 * are checked against the updated state. Any that lost ALL owners are orphaned
 * as a cleanup pass.
 *
 * ONE BODY PER PASS, THREE DOMAIN COLLABORATORS. {@link markOrphanedWith} and
 * {@link orphanUnownedFrozenPagesWith} are the bodies. They are handed
 * {@link OrphanPassSteps}: the confined page read, the dropped-read warning
 * (with its own presence decision) and the compile page write, each the whole
 * semantics of its existing owner and NOT a storage port. The root forms keep
 * their signatures and pass {@link localOrphanPassSteps}, which call
 * `readConfinedWikiPage`, `warnDroppedWikiReadIfPresent` and
 * `applyCompilePageWritesLocked` at call time with exactly the arguments they
 * always got, so their module spies still see every call. Every decision —
 * shared, unsafe, dropped, already orphaned, the rewrite, the status lines and
 * when the draft forgets the source — stays here. Status lines still go to the
 * incumbent `output.status`.
