/**
 * The wikilink targets a concept page may use, given to every concept-page
 * prompt in a compile.
 *
 * Pages are generated in parallel and written in one batch at the end, so
 * without this list a page never sees the titles of the pages written
 * alongside it and guesses link targets, which then fail to resolve. The list
 * is the same for every page in a compile (this compile's concepts first, then
 * existing pages, each sorted by title), so it adds no per-page variation.
 *
 * Each entry must resolve: a page whose slug is its slugified title is offered
 * by title, otherwise as an explicit `[[slug|Title]]` link. Titles come from
 * model extraction of untrusted sources, so they are reduced to one plain line
 * and any title that could form link syntax is dropped. The rendered list is
 * capped so a large wiki cannot crowd out the source.
