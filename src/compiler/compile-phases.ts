/**
 * @file src/compiler/compile-phases.ts
 * @description The compile phases that are the same work wherever a project
 * lives: deciding what changed, extracting concepts, and generating pages.
 *
 * These phases read a project only through {@link CompileAccess}, so they run
 * over a local directory and over a host-owned store alike. The orchestrator in
 * `compiler/index.ts` holds the project lock and owns everything that still
 * writes through a root path (live page batches, orphan marking, finalize); it
 * calls into here for the shared prefix and for page generation.
 *
 * {@link runReviewProposal} is the whole review-mode compile: it produces
 * candidates and mutates no wiki page and no compile state. The local
 * `compile --review` runs it, and so does a portable host — there is one
 * review-mode compile, not a second pipeline written for another backend.
