/**
 * The viewer's ONE read of a non-default profile's typed entity pages.
 *
 * `buildViewerSnapshot` needs the same corpus three times over — as page-surface
 * records, as graph nodes, and as the route allowlist — so it is collected here
 * exactly once and handed out in all three shapes. Collecting it per consumer
 * would mean three directory scans that could disagree with each other about
 * what the project contains.
 *
 * Returns `undefined` for the built-in DEFAULT profile. That is the single gate
 * behind every typed surface: with no result there are no typed pages, no typed
 * graph inputs, and no addressable typed directory, so a default project's
 * envelope, page route, search and graph are byte-identical. It is also what
 * keeps `collectEntityPages` — which THROWS on the default profile by design —
 * from ever being called on that path.
 *
 * Fail-closed and path-safe like the `status` / profile-summary surfaces: a
 * corrupt / too-new / symlinked relation store (or any read error) drops the
 * relation edges rather than crashing the snapshot, since those problems are
 * already surfaced through the `profile` summary block. The entity collector
 * never throws on page data, so a bad page is simply skipped.
 *
 * Profile-INVALID typed pages are excluded through the SHARED
 * {@link invalidEntityPagePaths}, the same predicate the context pool and the
 * per-type counts use. Applying it once, here, is what makes the page list, the
 * graph, `status` and lint describe one corpus: a page that fails its declared
 * field contract is not promoted to a real graph node, and is likewise not
 * offered as a readable page. It stays visible as a `field-violation` problem in
 * the envelope's `profileProblems`.
 *
 * ONE BODY: {@link collectTypedViewerInputs} runs
 * {@link collectTypedViewerInputsFrom} over local-disk {@link TypedViewerSources}.
 * The default-profile gate, declaration order, the invalid-page filter, the edge
 * projection and "any relation failure is no edges" are decided here.
