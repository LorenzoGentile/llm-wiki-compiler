/**
 * Shared writer for the `sources/` directory.
 *
 * Centralises the slug → filename resolution every ingest path needs, so
 * `ingest`, `ingest-session`, and any future ingester get the same
 * protections:
 *
 *  - Empty-slug guard (#35): titles that strip to "" (e.g. pure emoji)
 *    fail with an actionable error instead of writing `sources/.md`.
 *  - Stable basename-collision suffix (#36): two distinct sources that
 *    slugify to the same name coexist as `name.md` and
 *    `name-<8-hex-of-source>.md`; re-ingesting the same source still
 *    overwrites in place because the existing file's frontmatter
 *    `source` field is consulted before suffixing.
 *
 * ONE BODY: {@link saveSourceWith} keeps the slug guard, the identity scan, the
 * collision name, new-versus-update, the exclusive create and its EEXIST
 * refusal, the regular-file check and the stable-content comparison over
 * {@link SourceWriterLeaves}. {@link saveSource} keeps its signature and passes
 * {@link diskSourceWriterLeaves}, whose `openSourcesDir` keeps the incumbent
 * mkdir, canonical-root and real-directory checks and whose members call the
 * incumbent leaf helpers when asked. The returned `path` is the handle joined
 * with the file name, exactly as before.
 *
 * Which names count as existing identities is its own one body,
 * {@link listIdentityNamesFrom}, over {@link SourceIdentityReads}: the project's
 * source selection with its compile exclusions dropped.
