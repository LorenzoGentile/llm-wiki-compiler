/**
 * @file src/profile/artifact-lint.ts
 * @description Additive artifact-ref HEALTH findings, the read-surface mirror of
 * `relation-lint.ts`: every hash-pinned artifactRef value under a page's
 * declared fields OR a live relation's declared attributes is resolved against
 * the ACTUAL bytes (via `resolveArtifactRefFrom`, the bytes-verified reader in
 * `../artifacts/resolve.js`), and a non-`ok` health becomes a finding.
 *
 * Severity mirrors the relation-lint park/deny split: `artifact-unreadable` (a
 * transient read fault — cannot verify, not a confirmed violation) is a
 * `warning`; every other non-ok health (dangling / bytes-tampered /
 * hash-mismatch / schema-invalid / store-unavailable) is an `error`.
 *
 * `checkArtifactRefs` is the ONE resolution pass, reused by every read surface:
 *   - `lint.ts` consumes the `LintResult[]` directly;
 *   - `block.ts` (status/viewer) and `export/profile-block.ts` (export) consume
 *     the path-safe `EntityProblemView[]` from {@link artifactProblemViewsFrom}, a
 *     thin mapper over the SAME findings, and fold them into
 *     `snapshot.profile.problems`;
 *   - `context/pack-warnings.ts`'s `appendArtifactWarning` filters that SAME
 *     `snapshot.profile.problems` list for `kind === "artifact-store"` to
 *     surface a top-level `artifact-ref-unhealthy` warning — so all four
 *     surfaces can never disagree about which refs are unhealthy.
 *
 * `checkArtifactRefs` ALSO runs a second, PURE detective pass
 * ({@link checkGatedPageRequirements}): for a LIVE page CURRENTLY in a lifecycle
 * state that declares `transitionArtifactRequirements`, it flags each required
 * `{field, artifactType}` the page does NOT satisfy — the required field absent /
 * unparseable, or a ref pinning the WRONG artifact type. This is the read-side
 * backstop behind the write-time enforcer (`../artifacts/enforce-precondition.ts`):
 * it catches a profile that adds a requirement AFTER pages went live, and any
 * future write-path miss. A present ref of the RIGHT type emits nothing from this
 * pass — its bytes-health is already covered by the per-field health pass above, so
 * the two never double-report.
 *
 * A profile with no `artifacts` block declares no possible refs (and no
 * enforceable precondition), so this returns immediately — the
 * default/artifact-less profile's read surfaces stay byte-identical.
 *
 * ONE BODY. {@link checkArtifactRefs} runs it over local-disk sources
 * ({@link diskArtifactHealthSources}); the profile summary and the JSON
 * export's profile block run {@link artifactProblemViewsFrom} over their own.
 * The view mapping has no root-taking form. Which pages and
 * relation attributes are looked at, the order, what each outcome means, the
 * wording and the path rule are decided in this file.
 *
 * WHAT A PINNED REF RESOLVES TO IS A RAW BINDING. The check hands the artifact
 * store's leaf reads ({@link ArtifactStoreReads}) to the resolver's one body,
 * `resolveArtifactRefFrom`, so the resolver's whole verdict ladder runs on
 * what those reads serve and this file names no project root for it. What
 * answers the leaf reads on disk is unchanged: the store's confined readers.
 *
 * WHETHER A RUN VOUCHES FOR IT IS WORKED OUT HERE TOO, OVER RAW LEAVES. The
 * check hands the preparation store's leaf reads ({@link PreparationStoreLeafReads})
 * to the verifier's one body, `verifyExecutionProvenanceFrom`, through the one
 * composition `executionProvenanceReadsOver`: the inventory scan, the run
 * lookup, the sealed-input read, the run's authentication against the key and
 * the verdict all run on what those leaves serve. What answers the leaves on
 * disk is unchanged: the store's confined readers.
 *
 * ONE PART IS NOT A LEAF AND IS NOT MADE NEUTRAL: the lifecycle read the
 * inventory scan borrows, and the proof that it is genuine. On disk both stay
 * the real capture and check for the root, carried as the leaves' `lifecycle`
 * member. That is ROOT-BOUND LOCAL-DISK AUTHORITY, a named deferment, not an
 * accepted mechanism.
