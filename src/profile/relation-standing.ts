/**
 * @file src/profile/relation-standing.ts
 * @description The STANDING-INVARIANT read-side re-evaluation of relation-count
 * lifecycle preconditions.
 *
 * The write-side enforcer ({@link ../relations/enforce-precondition.js}) checks a
 * `transitionRelationRequirements` precondition only at the MOMENT a typed page
 * ENTERS a gated state. But relations are append-only and can later be
 * SUPERSEDED / COMPACTED / rendered dangling, and the profile can change — any of
 * which can leave a page STILL SITTING in a gated state whose precondition no
 * longer holds. This module surfaces that drift: it re-evaluates every entity page
 * CURRENTLY in a gated state against the CURRENT live-valid relation graph and
 * reports each standing violation.
 *
 * READ-ONLY + LOCK-FREE: it writes NOTHING and acquires NO lock. The relation
 * store is read EXACTLY ONCE per call (via the lock-free {@link readLiveValidRelations}),
 * and page state comes from the bounded frontmatter-only scan (no bodies). It
 * reuses the write path's PURE checker ({@link checkRelationPreconditions}) and the
 * write path's confined endpoint FACTS resolver ({@link makeEndpointFactsResolverFrom}),
 * so a standing check and a write agree, byte-for-byte, on both the count semantics
 * AND what "a qualifying endpoint" means (existing, field-contract-valid, and in
 * an allowed lifecycle state when the requirement filters on one).
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED, two-outcome, mirroring the enforcer's split: a genuine standing
 * violation is a {@link LIFECYCLE_RELATION_UNMET_KIND} problem (ACTIONABLE — names
 * the entity, relation type, role, needed vs actual count); a store that cannot be
 * READ is a DISTINCT {@link LIFECYCLE_RELATION_UNVERIFIABLE_KIND} problem ("cannot
 * verify", never a crash). Both surface through the SAME `EntityProblemView`
 * channel every read surface already renders, so no surface reports a drifted
 * project as silently healthy and a raw store throw never crashes a read surface.
 *
 * OMITTED-FOR-DEFAULT: a profile that declares no gated state reads NOTHING and
 * returns `[]`; a profile that declares gating but has no page currently in a gated
 * state also reads no relations. So the built-in default (no lifecycles) and any
 * non-gated profile add zero problems and stay byte-identical.
 *
 * ONE BODY: {@link collectStandingRelationProblems} runs
 * {@link collectStandingRelationProblemsFrom} over local-disk
 * {@link StandingRelationSources}. Which types and pages are gated, both short
 * circuits, the single relation read and both "cannot verify" catches are
 * decided in that body; the sources only look.
