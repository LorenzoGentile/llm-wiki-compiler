/**
 * Commander action for `llmwiki state reset` — the recovery escape hatch for a
 * `.llmwiki/state.json` written by a NEWER llmwiki version.
 *
 * When a state file's schema version exceeds what this build understands, every
 * command that reads state fails closed (it never clobbers a forward-incompatible
 * layout). That is the safe default, but it leaves a user on an older pin with no
 * in-app way forward. This command provides one: back up the offending state file
 * to `state.json.bak` and remove it so the next compile starts fresh.
 *
 * Crucially, the `--yes` path NEVER parses or validates the state — it operates on
 * the raw bytes — so it works even when the state is too-new or corrupt. The backup
 * is a single atomic `rename`, which both copies and removes in one step and
 * overwrites any prior `.bak`.
 *
 * SAFETY (mirrors the journal-dir trust boundary). The reset acquires the project
 * LOCK before touching state, so it can never race a concurrent compile/writeState;
 * if the lock is held it refuses cleanly rather than forcing. It also CONFINES the
 * `.llmwiki` dir to the project root's realpath — a symlinked `.llmwiki` (or a
 * state file whose parent escapes root) fails CLOSED and nothing outside root is
 * moved or clobbered. A confinement refusal is a FAILURE (exit code 1), distinct
 * from a benign ABSENT `.llmwiki` (nothing to reset → exit 0).
 *
 * ONE BODY EACH for the state path. {@link previewStateResetWith} (the dry run)
 * and {@link resetStateFileWith} (the confirmed reset) decide presence, the
 * escape and busy refusals, the backup-destination gate and the rename over
 * {@link StateResetSteps}. The containment decision (is `.llmwiki`'s realpath
 * inside the root's realpath?) is the body's; the two realpath observations, the
 * no-follow look, the raw rename and the lock stay the incumbent disk and host
 * mechanisms in `localStateResetSteps`. Every line the command prints is a
 * {@link StateResetNotice} reported at exactly the point it was printed before,
 * so no line moves relative to the lock.
 *
 * ONE BODY for every OTHER scope too. {@link runScopedResetWith} owns the
 * non-state controller (the scope check, the plan and its unavailable refusal,
 * the announcement, then — only with `--yes` — the lock, the executor handed the
 * PRINTED plan, its refusal and the exact deleted count, and the release) over
 * {@link ScopedResetSteps}, none of which takes a project root. The command
 * passes the local steps, which call the incumbent planner, lock and executor.
