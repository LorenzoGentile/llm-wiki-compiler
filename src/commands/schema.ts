/**
 * Commander actions for `llmwiki schema` subcommands.
 *
 * Exposes two operations:
 * - `schema init` writes a starter schema file seeded with sensible defaults
 *   so users can customise page kinds and cross-link minimums without
 *   hand-rolling the format.
 * - `schema show` prints the resolved schema a project would use, including
 *   which file (if any) it was loaded from — helpful for debugging.
 *
 * ONE BODY, NO ROOT, for `schema init`. {@link schemaInitCommandWith} owns its
 * decisions (the starter content, refuse-if-exists, then create the directory and
 * write, all under the project gate) over {@link SchemaInitSteps}.
 * {@link schemaInitCommand} keeps its signature, reads the working directory as
 * before, and passes the local steps, which call the incumbent gate, presence
 * look, directory creation and write when asked. `schema show` is one bound read
 * and a print, and stays as it is.
