/**
 * @file src/events/store.ts
 * @description The WRITE half of the append-only, hash-chained EVENT store.
 * Builds an {@link EventRecord} (minting an `evt_<ULID>` id, chaining `prevHash`
 * to the prior record's digest, computing the per-record checksum), APPENDS it to
 * `wiki/graph/events.jsonl` through the shared NO-FOLLOW O_APPEND primitive
 * (writing the header first when the store is empty), then SEALS the new record's
 * digest into the head anchor at `.llmwiki/events.head`.
 *
 * LOCKING: {@link appendEventLocked} is the lock-free core — it MUST run under a
 * lock the CALLER already holds, so an emit site that already holds the project
 * lock for its mutation (a lifecycle transition / relation append) co-commits the
 * event without a nested-acquire deadlock. {@link appendEvent} is the self-locking
 * entry point. {@link recordEvent} dispatches between them on `opts.locked`.
 *
 * WRITE PRECONDITION (verify-then-repair): {@link appendEventLocked} runs
 * {@link prepareEventStoreForAppendFrom} first. It VERIFIES the chain BEFORE any
 * repair, so a tampered/reordered chain throws BEFORE any append with the file
 * left BYTE-IDENTICAL (no re-sealing the head over a tampered chain — no
 * laundering). Only then are two UNCOMMITTED trailing states repaired: a torn
 * TRAILING line (a crashed prior append, truncated to the last valid record so the
 * new event never concatenates onto a partial line) AND the one-record-AHEAD crash
 * state (a complete record the head never sealed because a crash hit between
 * `appendLine` and `sealHeadAnchor` — dropped, since the head SEAL is the commit
 * point). Reads keep TOLERATING a torn tail (they never extend it).
 *
 * ORDERING: emit sites call this AFTER the durable mutation has landed, so the
 * event trails the mutation. A crash between the mutation and the append leaves a
 * missing trailing event — the torn-trailing case the reader tolerates and reports.
 * A crash between the append and the head seal leaves a one-ahead store, recovered
 * (the uncommitted record dropped) on the next write.
 *
 * SIZE CEILING: the append-only log has a hard size ceiling ({@link MAX_EVENT_STORE_BYTES}
 * for the whole file, {@link MAX_EVENT_RECORD_BYTES} per record). An append that
 * would reach/exceed either cap throws {@link EventStoreFullError} BEFORE writing,
 * so the store can never be driven past the read cap into a bricked state. ROTATION
 * and ARCHIVAL of an exhausted log are documented future items — not implemented here.
 *
 * ONE BODY over raw sources: {@link appendEventLocked} and
 * {@link preflightEventAppend} run {@link appendEventLockedFrom} and
 * {@link preflightEventAppendFrom} over local-disk {@link EventWriteSources}:
 * the repair sources plus the handle-held store append, the store's no-follow
 * byte size, and the head seal. Every decision (the chain, the repair, the
 * header choice, both caps, the record bytes, and the order append-then-seal)
 * stays in this file; the sources only answer. The disk members reach the
 * event-typed wrappers in `./store-record.ts` and `atomicWrite` through
 * `../utils/markdown.js` at call time. The operation-bound append runs
 * {@link appendBoundEventLockedFrom} over {@link EventBoundWriteSources}: the
 * same write sources plus the DURABLE whole-store replacement its header upgrade
 * (`./store-version.ts`) asks for, kept a member of its own.
